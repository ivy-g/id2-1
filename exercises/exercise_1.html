        <hr/>

        <p> <strong>In this Photoshop tutorial we’re going to learn how to create a web 2.0 layout, As we go through the tutorial we’ll deal with so many Photoshop techniques. Seems kind of long? that’s because it’s very detailed. I assure you’ll find easy to follow and to get done, just give it a try!

           </strong></p>
        <p>Complete the <a href="https://design.tutsplus.com/tutorials/create-a-professional-web-20-layout--psd-6380">Create a Professional Web 2.0 Layout Tutorial</a> on PSD Tuts. Don’t underestimate how long this tutorial will take you. It took me about 5 hours to complete and I have been using Photoshop since version 2. It will get confusing at some points, I apologize for that however, I feel that it is a valuable exercise anyway. The aesthetic is a bit dated—but, still it is good to know the techniques that the exercise delivers.
        </p>
        <p>As you work through the exercise, you will be asked to download some files that are free—go ahead. Don’t purchase anything, find a usable alternative. Use your own images and colors—but, follow the placement and grid in the exercise. If you prefer to, you can <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/2v8spia4pyds4wb/AAD9GfSlGUP_MBoHLV0qiQFSa?dl=0">download the assets that I used</a> at this link.
